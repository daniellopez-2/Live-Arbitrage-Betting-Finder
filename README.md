Pre-match betting, where you place a wager before a sports game or event starts, is probably the most common time to place a bet. This gives bettors time to analyze odds and lock in their bets before the action begins, without having to rush any decisions.

However, once the game or match is underway, live or in-play betting offers another exciting opportunity. As the name suggests, this form of betting allows you to place wagers during the event as the odds change in real-time. But can strategies like [arbitrage betting](https://getarbitragebets.com/arbitragebets), commonly used in pre-match betting, also be applied to live or in-play bets?

## What is Arbitrage Betting?

Arbitrage betting, in a nutshell, is a strategy where you bet on all possible outcomes of a sports game or event across different sportsbooks. Why? Because by taking advantage of the variations in odds offered by different sportsbooks, you can guarantee a profit no matter what happens.

## Can You Do Arbitrage on Live Betting?

Yes, arbitrage betting can be done during live sports events. During the course of a game, odds move more quickly and sometimes more dramatically than they did before the event began. These fluctuations can create multiple opportunities for [arbitrage betting](https://getarbitragebets.com/arbitragebets).

For example, in a basketball game, the odds of a team winning might shift significantly if they fall behind by 10 points early in the game. In this instance, one sportsbook might be faster in changing the odds theyâ€™re offering for the trailing team, while another might take longer to adjust.
